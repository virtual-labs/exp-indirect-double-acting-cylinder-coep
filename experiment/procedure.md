### Instructions to run pneumatic circuit to operate indirect double acting cylinder
1) Select Operation as indirect control of double acting cylinder
2) Select the component (Hold down the Ctrl (windows) or Command (Mac) button to select multiple options) as double acting cylinder return by spring, 3/2 DC Valve normally closed and 5/2 DC Valve.
3) Select method of actuation as Manually actuated and pneumatically actuated.
4) Click on check configuration. If it is correct the next level button is activated. Clcik on Next level button. 
5) On the left side you will see the library of components required to build the diagram and on the right side you will see the Workspace.
6) Point the mouse cursor to any component in library you will see the name of component.
7) Simply left click mouse button on component and drag it to the workspace.
8) Click on identify button if your identification will be wrong for 8 times then it will prompt a new button as identify hint for components.
9) After successful identification you need to connect the components with given ports with respective components.
10) Point mouse cursor to respective component circle it will become bold then select that circle and drag and drop to the respective component circle.
11) Click on check connection button if your connection will be wrong for 8 times then it will prompt a new button as conection hint for components.
12) After successful connection click next level button which will appear.
13) To initiate the process, close the V2 valve by pressing actuator of V2 valve. Then open V1 valve, by pressing actuator of V1 valve. So that air will pass through control valve towards cylinder and piston will move from left to right end position.
14) Once piston will reach to the right end position, now close V1 valve by pressing actator of V1 valve. Then open V2 valve by pressing actuator of V2 valve. so that piston will move from right to left position.
